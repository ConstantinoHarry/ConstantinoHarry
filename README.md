# Recent Projects:
---
## [**Deep Image Colorization**](https://github.com/ConstantinoHarry/deep-image-colorization)
- Deep image colorization using a Pix2Pix-style cGAN: a ResNet‑18–backed U‑Net predicts Lab color ab channels from grayscale L, with a PatchGAN discriminator enforcing local realism. A hybrid objective (L1 + adversarial + LPIPS) plus optional FAISS retrieval hints improves vibrancy and training stability. Trained on a curated Kaggle subset; results include PSNR ≈ 22.53 dB and SSIM ≈ 0.9162.

- Semantic grayscale‑to‑color translation with ResNet‑UNet + PatchGAN in Lab space. Hybrid losses (L1 + GAN + LPIPS) and optional FAISS retrieval guidance produce vibrant, realistic colors with stable training. Colab‑ready notebook with reproducible setup, training, evaluation, and galleries.

## [**FISCAL WISER**](https://github.com/ConstantinoHarry/Web-Development)
- FiscalWiser is a comprehensive financial planning web application designed to help users track income, expenses, budgets, retirement goals, and simulate paper trading for stocks and cryptocurrencies. The platform provides interactive charts, summary metrics, and persistent data storage for a seamless personal finance experience.
